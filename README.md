## Notion clone

I have tried to build the Notion clone application as part of learning **NextJs**. I learnt to use production ready tools like **Clerk authentication system** and **Convex real-time database** for optimised and performant application.


#### Features:

1. User should be authenticated using **gmail** or **github** to get started with the application
2. User can create new document 
3. User can change the title of the document which is updated in real time across the screen with help of **convex real time database**
4. User can **archive** the documents (**soft deleting**). Basically single document can have parent documents as well as children documents. If the Parent document is archived, all the children documents also will be archived
5. User can restore archived documents from the trash box
6. User need to **confirm** before delete the document permanently
7. User can add **cover image** to their documents 
8. User can pick the **favourite icon** for their document
9. User can **publish** their document and share the link with **others to access it**
10. User can **un-publish** their document so that others will **not have access** to it
11. User can **search** their documents
12. **Dark** mode is available
